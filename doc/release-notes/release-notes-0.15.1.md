  <https://github.com/gravitycash/gravitycoin/releases/tag/v0.15.1>


Notable changes
===============

New Difficulty adjustment timespan
----------------------------

Following block 47039, difficulty adjustments will be done per 6 hours, rather than the old default of 2 weeks. This is to reduce the cost incurred by large miners abandoning pools suddenly.
